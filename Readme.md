# xkcd 1625 in Chrome

This is a hastily-written Chrome extension that implements [xkcd #1625](http://xkcd.org/1625/)
in a pretty naive way. It doesn't preserve cases well, and will occasionally result in
grammatical errors.

## Attribution.

This tool's based off a shitty toolbar-button I implemented yesterday, that did bad things to
the DOM and was less than pretty.

I ended up ripping more than I probably ought to have from
[cloud-to-butt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

## Installation

Drag and drop xkcd1625.crx into chrome://extensions and blindly trust me not to do anything
nefarious.

## Example

This article should work pretty good, although it illustrates where the failure to preserve
case is obvious:
